  efficiently, and delivers for its customers, partners, and team members. Prior
  to his formal full-time role at Merritt, Brandon had a twenty-five-year
  professional career in the design-build|GC side of the industry, including
  senior executive leadership roles from medium sized contractors to one of the
  largest firms in the industry. In true Midwest fashion, Brandon grew up in a
  family of railroading, manufacturing, farming and building, and started
  spending time on major construction sites with family members in early high
  school. He later started formally working as a laborer and started his
  professional career in the field as a superintendent. He has worked in

  businesses while also driving them to operate more effectively and

  people, teams, companies, partnerships, and communities. In his role at
  Merritt, he continues this commitment to being a "builder" - while also being
  part of making|building some of the finest interiors in the world!
