  Since 2015 Jochen Schröcker has led Merritt’s Germany-based team of highly
  skilled craftsmen, integrating their work, heritage and operations with
  Merritt’s U.S.-based headquarters.



  Jochen is at heart a schreinermeister, German for master cabinetmaker. A third
  generation cabinetmaker, Jochen has been a master craftsman since 1994 and has
  worked in the yacht and international premium residential business for 18
  years.



  His remarkable career experience includes working on some of the world’s most
  extraordinary mega yachts including the Maltese Falcon, Royal Romance and
  Nourah of Riyadh. Ultra-luxury penthouses in St. Petersburg, Russia, Istanbul,
  Turkey and San Francisco, California confirm an experience delivering
  unparalleled millwork to clients for whom the best is the only option.



  Prior to joining Merritt, Jochen was a project manager, head of estimating and
  general manager for Sinnex Steinheimer Innenausbau, the prestigious German
  millwork firm. Germany is highly regarded for the value it places on craft,
  attention to detail and precision in execution. Jochen embodies these values
  and it informs his work and his team at Merritt every day.
