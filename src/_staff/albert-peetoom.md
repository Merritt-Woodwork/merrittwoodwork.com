  At Merritt I have been able to bring my experience as a professional yacht
  builder to bear on both Merrittâ€™s heritage of residential work, as well as its
  super yacht category. Finding new challenges in both continually drives me and
  my team to new levels of success.

  has taken on the role of Project Controls Manager, as well as managing select
  individual projects. His deep experience in the yachting industry,
  particularly interior outfitting, informs his work at Merritt every day, both
  residential and nautical. Delivering extraordinary results to Merritt clients
  continually drives Albert and the team to excellence.   Albert lives in
