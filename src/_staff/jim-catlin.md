  Jim has recently joined Merritt as VP of Business Development. A graduate of
  the Ben Franklin Institute in Boston, Catlin studied architecture at Boston
  Architectural College with the intention of becoming an architect. However,
  his first position out of school with a luxury custom millwork company
  cemented his passion for the art of high end interiors. Jim brings with him
  more than 30 years of experience in the luxury architecture and construction
  industries working with and for many of the country’s top architects,
  designers and contractors. His extensive industry knowledge, experience, and
  customer service skills add to the continued growth of Merritt as the industry
  leader in providing monumental architectural interiors.
