  Les Faircloth is a six-year member of the Merritt family. As a team leader and project executive, Les oversees a staff of excellent managers and engineers.

  Les brings both entrepreneurial and operational experience to his role at Merritt. Prior to entering the millwork industry, he owned and operated an international fiber optics company. Then acquired a struggling local millwork and cabinetry company.  In short order Les grew sales to more than $5 million annually while increasing production and decreasing cost. He grew market share by more than five times, expanded client potential from mid-range residential to high-end residential and commercial, and oversaw a staff expansion of eight to 38 employees in one year.  In 2009 he took his knowledge and skill to Merritt, the ultimate U.S. provider of luxury millwork and joinery.

  Today, Les combines his highly personal understanding of being a client and his experience operating a profitable and perfectionist millwork operation to his all his interactions with customers and co-workers.
