  Peter Staedler, one of Merrittâ€™s Project Principals, is responsible for
  projects from the very beginning until the end, when the project is delivered
  and installed. Those responsibilities include the oversight of the project,
  fiscal responsibility and adhering to budgets, engineering, procurement,
  coordination of manufacturing, delivery and installation. After graduating
  from college, Peter started his career at a cabinet shop in Switzerland, where
  he worked as a cabinet maker and installer. A few years later and prior to
  working at Merritt, he traveled to the United States and worked for
  Wavell-Huber Wood Products for 18 years. Building years of knowledge and
  experience in the industry, Peter was originally a cabinet maker, progressed
  to an installer for 10 years, and was then promoted to production manager for
  4 years. Outside of work, Peter loves spending time outdoors while camping,
  fishing and horseback riding.
