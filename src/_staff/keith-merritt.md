  Taking an architect’s dream and turning it into reality is a daily joy for my
  team. The challenges we face in the process become fuel driving us to exceed
  what we thought were limitations.

  Keith Merritt, younger son of founder George A. Merritt, has a long history
  within the company. Like his brother Michael, Keith has worked in nearly every
  position from production to manufacturing, logistics, plant management,
  engineering management, and project management. For many years he directly
  oversaw the day-to-day production operations.  Today he provides strategic
  leadership on technical topics, leads the implementation of strategic
  initiatives, provides input to teams on design and "buildability", and serves
  as master trainer, coach and mentor related to shop/production operations.
  Early on, Keith pledged himself to mastering old-world craftsmanship
  techniques to further Merritt’s foundation in the art of woodwork and joinery.
  This commitment combined with his passion for machinery and tools, positioned
  him perfectly for the strategic role he works in today. Along with the Merritt
  team, he continues to research the world's finest most advanced equipment and
  creative people to create exquisite monumental architectural millwork.
