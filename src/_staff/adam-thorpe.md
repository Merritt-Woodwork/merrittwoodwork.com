  Adam started woodcarving at an early age in his father’s home workshop in
  England. He apprenticed with British Master Carver Ian Agrell, and went on to
  study at the City and Guilds of London Art School. Since moving to the United
  States in 1992, he has worked on carving, restoration, and ornamental design
  for private residences, museums and furniture manufacturers. He was elected
  a member of the UK's Master Carver's Association in 1992.









  Adam joined Merritt in March of 2017 to lead the promotion and execution of
  design development for decorative and ornamental schemes. His responsibilities
  include ensuring effective communication of design intent through the
  manufacturing process, as well as internal and external education, and the
  marketing and promotion of classical decoration.









  One of Adam’s recently honored commissions includes the production of a replica
  Louis XVI console table for the Salon Doré installation at the Museum of the
  Legion of Honor, San Francisco. The project won the prestigious Julia Morgan
  Award for Craftsmanship and Artisanship in 2016.  Adam serves as Merritt’s
  representative to the Institute of Classical Art & Architecture (ICAA).
