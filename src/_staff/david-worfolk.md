  In 1972, with a degree in history, David Worfolk took a summer job in Connecticut helping to convert an old foundry into a full residence and immediately fell for the craft of carpentry. Ten years later, he started Design Woodworking in Lodi, California providing high-end custom architectural woodworking to Bay Area homeowners. In 1989, Stefan Sekula joined David and together they consistently grew DWW to lead the market until they merged with Merritt in 2016.

  In his role at DWW, David managed the financial, personnel and plant operations, as well as shared in project responsibilities regarding contracts, communications and project oversight. David takes great pride in nurturing and supporting a loyal workforce who share his commitment to quality, service and cooperation.
